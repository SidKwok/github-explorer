# github-explorer

> Rebuild with Vue 2.1

# Introduction

THIS github-explorer is based on Vue. You can check out the [ORIGINAL](https://github.com/trungdq88/github-explorer) version, which is based on React. If you are interested in Vue 1.0 version, you should visit [this](https://github.com/SidKwok/github-explorer/tree/1.x).

## Tips

I had deployed it on leancloud, so you can see [Live Demo](http://github-e.leanapp.cn). But if you would like to check the source code, you need to step to folder `fe`.

## Tech stack:

 - **VueJs** for UI
 - **vue-router** for Router
 - **vue-resource** for data fetching
 - **Vuex** for state management
 - **vue-cli** for building the project's structure

## Getting started

Go to The File Folder `fe` to do the command line!

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Checkout `localhost: 3000` in the browser!

If it doesn't work, try `sudo`ã€‚

To run the unit tests.
```bash
npm run unit
```

## Goals

 - Add route transition.
 - Finish unit tests.

## Bugs
